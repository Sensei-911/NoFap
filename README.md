### What's NoFap
NoFap is a website and community forum that serves as a support group for those who wish to give up pornography and masturbation. Its name comes from the slang term fap, referring to male masturbation. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoFap))

### NoFap Benefits
According to community:
- increased happiness
- boosted confidence
- increased motivation and willpower
- lower levels of stress and anxiety
- heightened spirituality
- self-acceptance
- improved attitude and appreciation toward other sexes

According to my own experiences: Confidence, long-term happinies, goal-oriented, more focused, more energitic, muscle growth, deep voice, improved communication ability, recovery depression and much more... And now I cant imagine a life without NoFap.

**Warning**: To achieve some of this you need to put extra effort and not all the benefits works for all people.
